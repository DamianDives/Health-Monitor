# Health-Monitor
# Real-Time Eye Movement Detection

## Overview

This project demonstrates a real-time eye movement detection system using computer vision and deep learning. The system detects a patient's eye movements and interprets them as requests for food or water based on the direction of the eye movement. This can be useful for monitoring patients who cannot communicate verbally.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- Tkinter (optional, for GUI)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
